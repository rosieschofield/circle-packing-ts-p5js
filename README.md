## Getting Started

NOTE: Do not use LiveServer - it will not compile your TypeScript into JavaScript!

### Installing

```
git clone THE_NAME_OF_THIS_REPO
```

```
cd THE_NAME_OF_THIS_REPO
yarn
```

### Running the dev server. !!NOT LiveServer!!

```
yarn start
```

A local version will now be running on [localhost:3000](http://localhost:3000).

Your browser should be automatically launched. If the screen is blank, reload the page once.

It should NOT normally be necessary to reload manually.

Edit the file [sketch/circlePacking.ts](sketch/circlePacking.ts) and whenever you save the browser should automatically be updated.
